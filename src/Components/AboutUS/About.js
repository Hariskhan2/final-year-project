        Welcome to Artsy Scrapyard, an e-commerce platform dedicated to
        promoting sustainability and creativity through the buying and selling

        items, which others can purchase and customize into unique works of art.
        We also provide resources for recycling and repurposing, including
        personalized recommendations based on uploaded images of scrap items.
        Join our community and discover the beauty and value in repurposing and
        recycling!
